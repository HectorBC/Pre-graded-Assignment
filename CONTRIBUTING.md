New contributor guide
To get an overview of the project, read the README. 

Getting started
To navigate our codebase with confidence, see the introduction to working in the docs repository.

Check to see what types of contributions we accept before making changes.

Issues
Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists.

Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters.

Make changes in the UI
Click Make a contribution at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the .md file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review.

Make changes in a codespace
For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "Working in a codespace."

Using the command line:

Fork the repo so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
Install or update to Node.js, at the version specified in .node-version. For more information, see the development guide.

Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
